   abstract = {Regular path queries (RPQs) select vertices connected by some path in a graph. The edge labels of such a path have to form a word that matches a given regular expression. We investigate the evaluation of RPQs with an additional constraint that prevents multiple traversals of the same vertices. Those regular simple path queries (RSPQs) quickly become intractable, even for basic languages such as (aa)* or a*ba*.In this paper, we establish a comprehensive classification of regular languages with respect to the complexity of the corresponding regular simple path query problem. More precisely, we identify for which languages RSPQs can be evaluated in polynomial time, and show that evaluation is NP-complete for languages outside this fragment. We thus fully characterize the frontier between tractability and intractability for RSPQs, and we refine our results to show the following trichotomy: evaluation of RSPQs is either AC0 , NL-complete or NP-complete in data complexity, depending on the language L. The fragment identified also admits a simple characterization in terms of regular expressions.Finally, we also discuss the complexity of deciding whether a language L belongs to the fragment above. We consider several alternative representations of L: DFAs, NFAs or regular expressions, and prove that this problem is NL-complete for the first representation and PSPACE-complete for the other two. As a conclusion we extend our results from edge-labeled graphs to vertex-labeled graphs.},

   abstract = {A fundamental query in labeled graphs is to determine if there exists a path between a given source and target vertices, such that the path satisfies a given label constraint. One of the powerful forms of specifying label constraints is through regular expressions, and the resulting problem of reachability queries under regular simple paths (RSP) form the core of many practical graph query languages such as SPARQL from W3C, Cypher of Neo4J, Oracle's PGQL and LDBC's G-CORE. Despite its importance, since it is known that answering RSP queries is NP-Hard, there are no scalable and practical solutions for answering reachability with full-range of regular expressions as constraints. In this paper, we circumvent this computational bottleneck by designing a random-walk based sampling algorithm called ARRIVAL, which is backed by theoretical guarantees on its expected quality. Extensive experiments on billion-sized real graph datasets with thousands of labels show that ARRIVAL to be 100 times faster than baseline strategies with an average accuracy of 95%.},

   abstract = {Given a large directed graph, rapidly answering reachability queries between source and target nodes is an important problem. Existing methods for reachability tradeoff indexing time and space versus query time performance. However, the biggest limitation of existing methods is that they do not scale to very large real-world graphs. We present a simple yet scalable reachability index, called GRAIL, that is based on the idea of randomized interval labeling and that can effectively handle very large graphs. Based on an extensive set of experiments, we show that while more sophisticated methods work better on small graphs, GRAIL is the only index that can scale to millions of nodes and edges. GRAIL has linear indexing time and space, and the query time ranges from constant time to being linear in the graph order and size. Our reference C++ implementations are open source and available for download at http://www.code.google.com/p/grail/.},

abstract = {Graph analytics on social networks, Web data, and communication networks has been widely used in a plethora of applications. Many graph analytics algorithms are based on breadth-first search (BFS) graph traversal, which is not only time-consuming for large datasets but also involves much redundant computation when executed multiple times from different start vertices. In this paper, we propose Multi-Source BFS (MS-BFS), an algorithm that is designed to run multiple concurrent BFSs over the same graph on a single CPU core while scaling up as the number of cores increases. MS-BFS leverages the properties of small-world networks, which apply to many real-world graphs, and enables efficient graph traversal that: (i) shares common computation across concurrent BFSs; (ii) greatly reduces the number of random memory accesses; and (iii) does not incur synchronization costs. We demonstrate how a real graph analytics application---all-vertices closeness centrality---can be efficiently solved with MS-BFS. Furthermore, we present an extensive experimental evaluation with both synthetic and real datasets, including Twitter and Wikipedia, showing that MS-BFS provides almost linear scalability with respect to the number of cores and excellent scalability for increasing graph sizes, outperforming state-of-the-art BFS algorithms by more than one order of magnitude when running a large number of BFSs.},

abstract = {Graph-based approaches to data analysis have become more widespread, which has given need for a query language for graphs. Such a graph query language needs not only SQL-like functionality for querying structured data, but also intrinsic support for typical graph-style applications: reachability analysis, path finding and graph construction.We propose a new query language for the popular Property Graph (PG) data model: the Property Graph Query Language (PGQL). PGQL is based on the paradigm of graph pattern matching, closely follows syntactic structures of SQL, and provides regular path queries with conditions on labels and properties to allow for reachability and path finding queries. Besides intrinsic vertex, edge and path types, PGQL also has the graph as intrinsic type and allows for graph construction and query composition.},

abstract = {In this paper we develop a new data structure for implementing heaps (priority queues). Our structure, Fibonacci heaps (abbreviated F-heaps), extends the binomial queues proposed by Vuillemin and studied further by Brown. F-heaps support arbitrary deletion from an n-item heap in O(log n) amortized time and all other standard heap operations in O(1) amortized time. Using F-heaps we are able to obtain improved running times for several network optimization algorithms. In particular, we obtain the following worst-case bounds, where n is the number of vertices and m the number of edges in the problem graph: O(n log n + m) for the single-source shortest path problem with nonnegative edge lengths, improved from O(mlog(m/n+2)n); O(n2log n + nm) for the all-pairs shortest path problem, improved from O(nm log(m/n+2)n); O(n2log n + nm) for the assignment problem (weighted bipartite matching), improved from O(nmlog(m/n+2)n); O(mβ(m, n)) for the minimum spanning tree problem, improved from O(mlog log(m/n+2)n); where β(m, n) = min {i | log(i)n ≤ m/n}. Note that β(m, n) ≤ log*n if m ≥ n. Of these results, the improved bound for minimum spanning trees is the most striking, although all the results give asymptotic improvements for graphs of appropriate densities.},
