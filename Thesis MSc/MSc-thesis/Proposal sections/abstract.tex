This thesis will focus on implementing path finding algorithms in the open-source in-process SQL OLAP database management system DuckDB. This is done to further complete the integration of SQL/PGQ, an extension of SQL, in DuckDB. 
The algorithms, one of which is a batched version of Bellman-Ford, will make it possible to retrieve the path length between any two nodes in a (weighted) graph. 
Batched Bellman-Ford and other algorithms, will be implemented as user-defined functions in DuckDB, which make for a lightweight approach that does not alter the internal workings of DuckDB.
In addition, possible optimizations in DuckDB for graph-like queries will be identified and implemented.
